# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Task-01 Overview
As part of my Machine Learning internship, I completed Task-01 which involved building a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on:

- Square footage of the house (`GrLivArea`)
- Number of bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)
- Number of bathrooms (`FullBath`, `HalfBath`)

## 🧠 Objective

Implement and evaluate a linear regression model that takes **square footage**, **number of bedrooms**, and **bathrooms** as inputs, and predicts the **sale price** of a house.
